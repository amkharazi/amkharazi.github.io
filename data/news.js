            description: "And so, the grand adventure of CompNeuro 2025 has reached its final chapter. Once more, I served as a trusted guide — a Teaching Assistant — helping brave minds navigate the winding pathways of neural knowledge. The halls of NMA now grow quiet, yet the echoes of lively debates and shared victories remain. Whether you seek to embark as an eager apprentice or return as a seasoned mentor, I urge you: answer the call when the academy’s gates open again next year.",

            description: "The ancient manuscript, *Hierarchical Local-Global Tensor Layer (HLGTL) in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*, has journeyed through the trials of the Review Realms and emerged into the perilous Revision Stage. The new incantations have been inscribed, the seals re-forged, and the tome has been returned to the High Council of Reviewers. Now we await their final judgment, uncertain if we shall receive the golden seal of acceptance or be sent on yet another scholarly quest.",
